Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]        image --> https://prnt.sc/9x-J1CdyKDxF
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
